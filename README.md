# week-4-game
A variant of the "Star Wars RPG" assignment


This will be an RPG game in which the play chooses one fighter out of four and fights against the remaining three one by one. Each character has three attributes:

Health, which is carried over for the player from fight to fight
Attack, which applies when the character is controlled by the player. Attack increases in arithmetic progression each time the player attacks. The player's Attack power is carried over from fight to fight.
Counter Attack, which applies when the character is controlled by the computer. This value is fixed.
